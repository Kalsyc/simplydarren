## About SayNoToUILibraries

A website that houses all the native ways to build UI components from scratch with plain HTML, CSS and JS. My vision was for users to be able to build their own and test functionality like in Storyboard, and at the same time bundle them to use in their own application (with any frontend framework of choice).

## Current Progress

Right now the website is only functional for the playground where I tried to clone a HTML/CSS/JS Editor. [It works!](https://saynotouilibraries.netlify.app/playground)
