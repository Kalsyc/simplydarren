## About Yobu

A social gaming media platform where users can play simple games (akin to old Flash games of the past) online (and multiplayer). Users are also able to chat with the community and video call one another whilst gaming. Picture it as a combination of Discord and Steam!

## Current Progress

Current plan is to make it a Telegram clone for now so that I can learn how to deal with socket.io :)

A personal project that will be underway soon enough!
