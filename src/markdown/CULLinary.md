## Preface

CULLinary is a student game project from the module CS3247: Game Development @ National University of Singapore (NUS). I took this module in AY20/21 Semester 2 under Prof Anand Bhojan. This page showcases my group's (Team Angry Eggplant) development notes from my perspective as well as some of the challenges I faced.

[You may choose to play the game here](https://www.simplydarren.com/projects/cull1)

[Or watch our trailer first!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKpQ_maMmHE)

We also entered the 18th iSTePS showcase in which we clinched 1st place out of 8 teams. :) Not gonna lie but the game is actually quite fun and it'll be your introduction to the series (which will later be followed by the more complete and dynamic second game CULLinary2). Have fun!

## Technical Details

We used Unity 2020.2.3f1 and a lot of C# madness for this game. Our animator and designer in chief also used Blender for some of the modeling and animations :)

## Useful Links

The game can either be played on the browser or via an executable (Available on Windows, MacOS and Linux) which can be downloaded from the Releases on our GitHub repository. Instructions to download are in the repository's README.
