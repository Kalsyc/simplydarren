## Preface

Great! Now that you have installed Unity Hub, let's start with creating a project. For this lab, our main focus is to introduce you to the Unity Editor as well as to build a simple environment!

## How To Create A Project

To create a project, click the "New Project" button under the Projects tab.

</p>

After you clicked on New Project. Turn your attention to the Editor Version situated at the top. Ensure that you select the correct version as different Unity Versions may affect compatibility with future assets and SDKs.

It is recommended that you decide on a version early as trying to change the version in the midst of your project might actually break things!

</p>

Now I have 2020.3.8f1 selected. However, for this project, let's select 2021.2.8f1 for Silicon as that's the platform I am using.

</p>

After that is done, let me explain a bit of what's going on below. For Unity, there are quite a number of templates that you can choose from to get started. These templates come with presets for you that is configured to the platform/setting that you are trying to build for. For this lab (Lab 1 & 2), we are going to start with the basic 3D template.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="" style="margin: 0 auto; object-fit:fill; max-width:700px" src="/img/unity-tut/lab1/project-unity-template-img.png" width="90%" height="auto" />
</p>

After selecting the template, you can give your project a name and then choose the location that you are going to store your project in, and then click on 'Create Project'!

Psst, you can now go for a quick coffee break if you want because the first-time setup might take a while (especially if your computer is slow).
