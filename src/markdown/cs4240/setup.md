## Preface

Hello! I'm Darren, your lovely TA for this semester's (S2 AY2122) iteration of CS4240: Interaction Design in Virtual and Augmented Reality. I have taken this chance to write this tutorial for you if you so happen to use the newer version of Unity (2021.2.8f1).

For this Setup and Lab 1, 2 & 3, we will be using MacOS M1 as well. You should be able to follow along if you are using Windows for the Setup, Lab 1 & 2. Else, head to VARlabs instead [here](https://varlabs.comp.nus.edu.sg/unitylab/index.html).

I'm writing this in parallel to the tutorials in VARlabs so that we don't get too confused over the different versions of Unity haha. It is PERFECTLY fine to follow VARlabs as it has been tried and tested :)

## Specifications of my machine:

- 2020 13-inch Macbook Air
- Apple M1 chip with 8‑core CPU, 8‑core GPU and 16‑core Neural Engine
- 16GB unified memory

## How To Get Started

Firstly, you'll need to install the latest Unity Hub 3.0 [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) which comes in this fancy new interface!

</p>

Unity Hub is basically a version control/manager for all of your Unity Projects. To get started, you'll need to a Unity ID. Since you're a student @ NUS, do note that as part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack (which you can get for free as a student), you'll be able to get the Unity Student Plan which comes with free perks.

## After installing Unity Hub

After installing Unity Hub, you should be able to launch it and install the latest Unity Version. For now, we are using 2021.2.8f1 which can be installed by clicking 'Install Editor' under the 'Installs' tab. Note that this might take a while depending on your internet speed.

</p>

If you are using an M1 Macbook, select the 'Install' option with Silicon. Else, select the 'Install' option with Intel.

After clicking install, they may prompt you to download platforms. For now, all you need to do is to download Visual studio (if you haven't already) and the documentation. You can always return and install the required build packages later if you wish to build your Unity application on iOS or WebGL for example.

After the installation is complete, you should be able to create a brand new project :)
