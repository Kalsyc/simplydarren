### Problem Statement

We decided to focus on youth with regards to personal finances and noticed the following main problems:

1. Financial literacy not formally taught
2. Lack of savings among millenials
3. Lack of discipline to save

Currently, there exists solutions or spending trackers such as Seedly that monitors users' expenses and even categorises their expenses for them.

However, they **do not cater to a younger audience** who may lack the discipline to use the application on a consistent basis.

Hence, our solution, PetSaver, will help to instill that discipline by gamifying our way of saving money. Inspired by tamogotchi and gamified productivity apps, PetSaver will encourage users to save money in return for raising their very own virtual pet.
